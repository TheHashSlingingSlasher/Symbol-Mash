# *_Symbol-Mash_*

## Overview

Symbol-Mash is a suite of mathematics software with a focus on symbolic computation.


## Features

Ability to symbolically compute..
* Derivatives of functions of a single variable
* Integrals of functions of a single variable

Ability to operate on numerical values with...
* Matrices

## Basic Examples

**Derivative**

    define f(x) = cos(x)
    differentiate f(x)
Output

    sin(x)

**Integral**

    define g(x) = sin(x)
    integrate g(x)
	
Output

    -cos(x) +  C
